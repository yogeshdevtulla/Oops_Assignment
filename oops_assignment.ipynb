    "When working with classes in Python, the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance."
